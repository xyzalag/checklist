# Checklist – JavaScript Project. 
The list was initially an exercise (day 15, JavaScript 30 Days Challenge by Wes Bos).  I decided to further develop ‘tapas list’ which eventually turned into ‘productivity app’. The fun part is the use of local storage and event delegation. (the script compiled with Babel)
